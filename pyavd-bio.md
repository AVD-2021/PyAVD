# PyAVD - The -Literal- Plane Designer 

### AVD Group 11, Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London

Let's paint a familiar picture-

You want to buy a plane. That's cool, don't we all.

But you don't want just any plane, no. It has to be *perfect*.

Clearly, you have an idea of what you want - say - to fly from your local airport to the Monaco Grand Prix.

So your first thought of course is, *Dang, I should design it myself* - I don't need to buy from the several hundred other aircraft that have been built, tested and flown reliably for years.

Nope. You are a person of great taste. Your aircraft must be bespoke.

But there's that slight inconvenience that you are not, in fact, an aircraft designer. Heck, you don't even know why planes stay up in the air.

And upon this revelation, you also realise that indeed, you are not nearly rich enough to afford an aircraft, let alone a custom one.

So you are stuck.
