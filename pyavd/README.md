# PyAVD - The -Literal- Plane Designer 

### AVD Group 11, Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London

Let's paint a familiar picture-

You want to buy a plane. That's cool, don't we all.

But you don't want just any plane, no. It has to be *perfect*.

Clearly, you have an idea of what you want - say - to fly from your local airport to the Italian Grand Prix with a pair of Ferrari mascots.

So your first thought of course is, *Dang, I should design it myself* - I don't need to buy from the several hundred other aircraft that have been built, tested and flown reliably for years. Nope.

You are a person of great taste. You know exactly what you need. Your aircraft has got to be bespoke.

But there's that slight inconvenience that you are not, in fact, an aircraft designer. Heck, you barely know why planes stay up in the air.

And upon this revelation, you also realise that indeed, you are not nearly rich enough to afford an aircraft, let alone a custom one.

And in fact, you have been day-dreaming in the middle of an 11-hour AVD group call. Typical.

Does this scene seem familiar? Of course it does.

Suddenly you think, what if there was, in fact, a way to -solve- AVD?

What if there were a few **buttons** you could click to spit out that dream aircraft? (Or perhaps Errikos' AVD aircraft, no biggie)

And then there was PyAVD. The end.
